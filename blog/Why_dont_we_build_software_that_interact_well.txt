There is a reason why both Shell scripts(with plain text files) and Excel are used a lot, despite the general dislike to both. I know some of you will not be happy of placing Shell and Excel in the same sentence. I'm not a fan of Excel either, but I think there is a fundamental concept that makes me to put them together.

I'm not sure what to write. I have to write something today. But I'm not sure what to do so. This is an experiment for about 30 days. I want to write for the next 30 days continuously. I have to think about something that I would like to share, and express my thoughts in words. 

It is not as easy as it seems. Writing right off your mind without any research is crazy. 

Goals!
